# MatrixMultiplication
This project is to perform matrix multiplication in parallel by combining the Naive Matrix Multiplication Algorithm and Strassen's Matrix Multiplication Algorithm to produce hybrid algorithms that enable parallel matrix multiplication computation and produce better results in the form of shorter execution times.
# Project Structure
* sequential.cpp - CPP file for sequential naive and strassen matrix multiplication implementations
* omp_strassen.cpp - CPP file for OpenMP implementation
* mpi_strassen.cpp - CPP file for MPI implementation
# Contribution
